# A Brushless DC Motor Tester

There's a need for a brushless motor tester. Since our focus and interest is slot car racing the focus should be on brushless motors used for slot car racing.

If you are keeping abreast of the subject you'll be aware there are some solutions out there already, notably:

  - [The Latvian K<sub>v</sub> Tester](https://www.latslot.lv/products/kv-meter)   
  - [The AEO K<sub>v</sub> Meter](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154220029114)  
  - [Things on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008982133782.html)  
  - do-slot?  

However it would be cool to do this as a community project.

We have most of the bits and pieces to do one of these already, namely:

  - An eCom that'll drive any motor.  
  - The capability to alter the eCom (WiFi Link).  
  - A "clamp" to protect the WiFi Link.  

There's some other prototype parts that we have in our toolbox - like a Hall sensor and a 3D printed bracket for this that can be contributed.

However it's just a collection of parts and will need some effort to design a finished solution that'll probably need to comprise not only the above but also:

  - A microprocessor to run it all (like a Pi Pico).  
  - Some (python?) code to drive it.  
  - An OLED display.  
  - A container.  
  - Fuses.  
  - Connections.  
  - etc.  

The starting point would be a requirements document to focus the effort so we know what we are building. Given the requirements document we could divide up the effort to people with skills to do the CAD design of the parts and circuit boards (if any), and the programming etc.

This would all be open source so that anyone could make one of these for themselves and there'll be the opportunity for anyone to commericalize this as long as they agree to make a contribution back to the project.

So who is up for it?
